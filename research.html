      <h2>Research Journey</h2>



      <p><b style="font-size:20px">Protein Structure Biology and Drug Design:</b> Started my research career as a fan of protein structure and grew a keen interest
        in understanding their mechanism of action in molecular level. In my PhD started with viral protein structure 
        [<a href="https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-10-6">link</a>] and my PhD
        supervisors taught me how to feel the data flowing inside biological incidents and how to tell a story simply from letters and 
        numbers. Started with the structures of neuraminidase protein of Influenza virus and later my flow of my interest helped me
        explore the proteins from other viruses, leishmania, etc. and finally to mammals like mouse and human. I had an excellent 
        training during my postdoctoral research at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics on how to extract interesting biological information
        from protein crystallography data. Attached to the same string, in-silico design of small molecule based drug I applied first 
        time in Leishmania genome through comparative genomics strategy [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1756-0500-7-802">link</a>]. 
        Later applied these structural biology knowledge to publish papers in the domain of peptide drug candidate, 
        molecular dynamics simulation [<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4844938/">link</a>].
      </p>



      <p><b style="font-size:20px">Genomics & Sequence Motifs:</b> After spending a long research path in structural bioinformatics, from 2015, my
        curiosity started to incline towards the field of genomics and a deeper molecular origin of protein structure. Since then I explored genomics in 
        different domains of biology: Viral genomics, mouse and human genomics, immunogenomics and other levels in molecular genomics.
        Particularly secondary structural motifs in DNA and their regulatory roles is a specific area of interest for me
        [<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007334">link</a>]. 
        Tools and skills of Next generation sequence analyses are the domains I always projected in my career skill and feel comfortable
        with. IBS, POSTECH, South Korea with immunology, I had a chance to explore the gut microbiome and their interaction with 
        immune cells [<a href="https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/3/28/eaat6975?utm_campaign=toc_imm_2018-10-19&et_rid=79676282&et_cid=2438185">link</a>]. 
        Prediction of epitopes & immunogenic peptides is also a great area of interest to me. Currently as a Marie Curie
        Career-FIT fellow at University College Dublin I am working on food proteolysis and biologically active peptides obtained from food
        proteins like proteins from Milk.
      </p>



      <p><b style="font-size:20px">Viral genomics and Bioinformatics:</b> Starting with genomics and structural biology of neuraminidase protein of influenza virus,
        I have explored different viral models to investigate antiviral strategies. My first attempt was to predict conserved epitopic
        regions of neuraminidase protein, which can be used as a vaccine [<a href="https://bmcstructbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6807-10-6">link</a>]. 
        Later applied the same algorithm on rotaviral protein VP7 [<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040749">link</a>] 
        and proposed vaccine candidates. With time, after growing interest in genomics and structure biology, I became involved  with the DNA secondary
        structure mediated regulatory genomics of cytomegalovirus 
        [<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?rev=2&id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007334">link</a>].         
      </p>



      <p><b style="font-size:20px">Algorithms and Bioinformatics Pipelines:</b> For running bioinformatics analysis I have created several pipelines in domains of Bioinformatics 
        where I worked and published paper. Initially, I started with 20D-algorithm [<a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/in-silico-biology/isb00389">link</a>] based
        number crunching pipelines and applied to the detection of viral vaccine/epitopic candidates. Later, when I was working with drug design pipelines, had a chance to
        develop the comparative-genomics to small molecule drug design pipeline which one was really exciting [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1756-0500-7-802">link</a>].
        Later I extended the drug design pipeline to the world of molecular dynamics simulations with both small molecules and peptides 
        [<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006291X16314590">link</a>]. 
        When I started to integrate myself towards genomics several areas I have explored like pipelines related to genome to: secondary structural motif
        prediction, microbiome analysis, RNAseq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, mutation analysis and many other in the stream. Among algorithms, I worked on two algorithms
        related to 20D euclidean space: one is for predicting peptide variability along protein sequence and the second one is to predict phylogenetic relationship
        within a bunch of proteins [<a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/in-silico-biology/isb00389">link</a>].
